## What is EVA?

EVA is a visual data management system (think MySQL for videos). It supports a declarative language similar to SQL and a wide range of commonly used  computer vision models.

## What does EVA do?

* EVA **enables querying of visual data** in user facing applications by providing a simple SQL-like interface for a wide range of commonly used computer vision models.

* EVA **improves throughput** by introducing sampling, filtering, and caching techniques.

* EVA **improves accuracy** by introducing state-of-the-art model specialization and selection algorithms.

## Installation

Installation of EVA involves setting a virtual environment using [miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and configuring git hooks.

1. Clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/georgia-tech-db/eva.git
```

2. Install the dependencies.
```shell
sh script/install/before_install.sh
export PATH="$HOME/miniconda/bin:$PATH"
sh script/install/install.sh
```

3. Connect mysql user root with normal account and no password
```mysql
sudo mysql -u root
> SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;
> DROP USER 'root'@'localhost';
> CREATE USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '';
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql -u root
```
refer to [askubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/766334/cant-login-as-mysql-user-root-from-normal-user-account-in-ubuntu-16-04)

4. Install `docker` and `docker-compose`.
Please refer to [official doc](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Client Testing

1. Set up the server and client

- Launch EVA database Server: `python eva.py`

- Launch CLI: `python eva_cmd_client.py`

2. Run the `UPLOAD` command in the client terminal:
```mysql
UPLOAD INFILE 'data/ua_detrac/ua_detrac.mp4' PATH 'test_video.mp4';
```

3. Run the `LOAD` command in the client terminal: (may take a while)
```mysql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'test_video.mp4' INTO MyVideo;
```

4. Below is a basic query that should work on the client
```mysql
SELECT id, data FROM MyVideo WHERE id < 5;
```



## Docker

1. Standup EVA testing for CPU/GPU hardware.
```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml eva-test-[cpu/gpu] up
```

## Development

1. Install git hooks in your .git/ directory. [optional, but recommended]
```shell
conda activate eva
pre-commit install
```

2. Ensure that all the unit test cases (including the ones you have added) run succesfully and the coding style conventions are followed.
```shell
bash script/test/test.sh
```

## Quickstart Tutorial

### Configure GPU (Recommended)

1. If your workstation has a GPU, you need to first set it up and configure it. You can run the following command first to check your hardware capabilities. 

    ```
    ubuntu-drivers devices
    ```

    If you do have an NVIDIA GPU, and its not been configured yet, follow all the steps in this link carefully. `https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-gpu-installation-on-ubuntu-18-4-9b12230a1d31`. 

    Some pointers:
    - When installing NVIDIA drivers, check the correct driver version for your GPU to avoid compatibiility issues. 
    - When installing cuDNN, you will have to create an account. Make sure you get the correct deb files for your OS and architecture. 

2. You can run the following code in a jupyter instance to verify your GPU is working well along with PyTorch.

    ```
    import torch
    device = torch.device('cuda:0' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
    print(device)
    ```

    Output of `cuda:0` indicates the presence of a GPU. (Note: 0 indicates the index of the GPU in system. Incase you have multiple GPUs, the index needs to be accordingly changed)

2. Now configure the `executor` section in `eva.yml` as follows:

    ```
    gpus: {'127.0.1.1': [0]}
    ```
    
    `127.0.1.1` is the loopback address on which the eva server is started. 0 refers to the GPU index to be used. 

### Sample Notebook

1. Open a terminal instance and start the server:
    ```
    python eva.py
    ```

2. Open another terminal instance. Start a jupyter lab/notebook instance, and navigate to `tutorials/object_detection.ipynb`

3. You might have to install ipywidgets to visualize the input video and output. Follow steps in `https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_install.html` as per your jupyter environment. 

4. Run each cell one by one. Each cell is self-explanatory. If everything has been configured correctly you should be able to see a ipywidgets Video instance with the bounding boxes output of the executed query.  

## Architecture

EVA consists of four core components:

* EVAQL Query Parser
* Query Optimizer
* Query Execution Engine (Filters + Deep Learning Models)
* Distributed Storage Engine
